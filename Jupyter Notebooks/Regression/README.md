# Regression Problems

With linear regression we aim to fit a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to a dataset. 
Regression in general may be performed for a variety of reasons: 

- to produce a so-called trend line (or curve) that can be used to help visually summarize, drive home a particular point about the
data under study, or
- to learn a model so that precise predictions can be made regarding output values in the future
